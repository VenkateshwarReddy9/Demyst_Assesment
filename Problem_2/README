 Detailed Explanation of the Code

 1. Data Generation

# Libraries Used
- `Faker`: Generates realistic fake data for testing purposes.
- `csv`: Writes the data to a CSV file.

# Key Steps
1. File Parameters:
   - `output_file`: Name of the generated CSV file.
   - `num_rows`: Number of rows to generate (1,000,000 rows in this case).

2. Column Names:
   - `columns`: Defines the fields for the dataset, including `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, and `date_of_birth`.

3. Data Generation:
   - A loop generates each row with random data:
     - `first_name` and `last_name`: Random names.
     - `address`: Random address, with line breaks replaced by commas.
     - `date_of_birth`: Random date of birth for individuals aged 18 to 80.

4. Write to File:
   - Writes the header row followed by generated data rows into `sample_data.csv`.

 2. Anonymization

# Purpose
To mask sensitive data (e.g., names, addresses) using a hashing algorithm. Two approaches are implemented:

---

# Local Processing:

1. `anonymize(value, salt)` Function:
   - Uses SHA-256 to hash the input value concatenated with a salt (`random_salt` by default). Hashing ensures that the original data cannot be reconstructed.

2. Anonymization Logic:
   - Reads the CSV file in chunks to reduce memory usage.
   - For each chunk:
     - Applies the `anonymize` function to sensitive columns (`first_name`, `last_name`, `address`).
     - Buffers the processed rows in memory.
   - Writes the anonymized rows to a new CSV file once the buffer size reaches `chunk_size` (100,000 rows).

3. Why Chunking?
   - Prevents excessive memory usage when processing large files.

# Distributed Processing with Spark:

1. Spark Initialization:
   - A `SparkSession` is created with memory allocation configured (`4g` for both executor and driver).

2. Read the CSV File:
   - Loads the input CSV into a Spark DataFrame using `spark.read.csv`.

3. Column Anonymization:
   - Uses Spark's built-in functions (`sha2` for hashing) to anonymize columns.
   - Columns (`first_name`, `last_name`, `address`) are hashed with a salt using:
     ```python
     sha2(concat_ws("", column_name, lit(salt)), 256)
     ```
   - `concat_ws` concatenates the column value with the salt, and `sha2` hashes the result.

4. Write Anonymized Data:
   - The anonymized DataFrame is written to a new CSV file in distributed fashion.

5. When to Use Spark:
   - Suitable for large files (>1GB) or datasets requiring distributed processing for efficiency.

 3. File Size Determination

The `get_file_size` function checks the size of the file to determine the appropriate anonymization method:
- If the file size is ≤1GB, local processing is used.
- If the file size is >1GB, Spark is used for distributed processing.

---

 4. Main Program Logic

1. Generate Dataset:
   - A CSV file (`sample_data.csv`) with 1,000,000 rows is created (~2GB size for this example).

2. Determine File Size:
   - The size of the file is calculated in GB using `os.path.getsize`.

3. Anonymization Method:
   - Files ≤1GB: Process locally using `anonymize_csv_locally`.
   - Files >1GB: Use Spark's distributed processing with `anonymize_csv_with_spark`.

4. Anonymized Output:
   - Local anonymized file: `anonymized_data_local.csv`.
   - Spark anonymized file: `anonymized_data_spark.csv`.

 Key Concepts Demonstrated

# Data Generation
- Scalability: Generates a realistic dataset of arbitrary size.
- Reusability: Can adjust columns and row count to simulate different datasets.

# Anonymization Techniques
1. Hashing with Salt:
   - Secure way to mask sensitive data.
   - Ensures repeatability while protecting the original values.

2. Local vs. Distributed Processing:
   - Efficient chunk-based processing for smaller files.
   - Scalable distributed processing with Spark for larger datasets.

# File Handling
- Efficient use of resources via chunking and Spark's distributed framework.
- Compatibility with large datasets without overwhelming memory.
